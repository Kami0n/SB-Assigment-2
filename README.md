# Code for Assigment no. 2 for subject Image-based Biometry

This is my code for second assigment.

## Goals of second assigment
In this assigment we will be learning about first three steps in biometric recognition pipeline:
1. data acquisition
2. pre-processin
3. detection (segmentation)


## What did I do?

0. tried to run VJ detector for ears, to get the feeling of how this code framework works
1. selected dataset WIDER with annotated faces
2. programmed mAP (mean average precision) metric
3. tested 
4. tested 
5. tested 

### Evaluated detectors:
#### Results:
ÄŒas je izmerjen za 181 izbranih fotografij (WIDER, awards).
